threads_3.txt

Further experiments with Python threading using functions in timer.py and
writer.py with the pysh REPL from pyshell.py.

In this demonstration, we show a thread updating a buffer in one window,
while we edit text in another buffer in its window, and type at our pysh
REPL to control  the thread.

>> o2()
>> e('a.txt')
a.txt, 0 lines
>> ta = Timer()
>> abuf = Writer('a.txt')
>> Thread(target=ta.timer,args=(1000,5,'A',abuf)).start()
>> on()
>> tpm()

Then M-x >> from threads_3 import *  so you can do >> threads()  >> ta.delay = 1
etc.
