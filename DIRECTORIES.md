Piety directories
=================

The Piety repository is organized into these directories:

- **bin**: shell scripts that configure Piety for Unix-like platforms.

- **doc**: notes and documents.

- **editors**: display editor *edsel*.

- **shells**: callable Python interpreter.

- **unix**: modules for running Piety on a Unix-like host.

- **util**: miscellaneous utilities that are not
    platform-dependent or configuration-dependent, that are used by
    modules in more than one directory.

- **vt_terminal**: modules for running Piety terminal applications on
    a VT-100 compatible terminal or terminal emulator program (for
    example *xterm*). 

Each directory contains a *README* file with more information.
Another page explains the [rationale](doc/modules.md) for this organization.
