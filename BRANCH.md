This is the *ed* branch, branched from the *rewrite* branch.

Make the new *editors* directory and begin our line editor *sked.py*,
inspired by the classic Unix *ed*, but even simpler.

Beginning in Feb 2023, a total rewrite of the Piety system is underway
here in the *rewrite* branch and its branches, to simplify the code
and improve its organization and clarity.

Recent work in the *rewrite* branch:

- 9 Feb 2023: Remove *shells* directory and *pycall*, not needed.

- 2 Feb 2023: Make the *ed* branch for work on our line editor *sked.py*.

- 1 Feb 2023: Add *shells* directory with *pycall* callable Python interpreter.

- 1 Feb 2023: Delete most files and directories for a fresh start.
  Revise *BRANCH.md*, *DIRECTORIES.md*, and *bin/paths*.
