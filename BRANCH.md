========

This is the *fparam* branch, branched from the *ed* branch,
which itself is branched from the *rewrite* branch.

Beginning in Feb 2023, a total rewrite of the Piety system is underway
here in the *rewrite* branch and its branches, to shorten and simplify 
the code, and improve the responsiveness of the programming environment.

Recent work in the *rewrite* branch:

-  8 Apr 2023 Make *fparam* branch of *ed* branch to work on display code.
   Instead of patching functions in *sked*, display functions are passed 
   as parameters to functions in *sked*.

-  8 Apr 2023: Reach stopping place in *patch* branch, merge back into *ed*.

- 20 Feb 2023: Make *patch* branch of *ed* branch to work on display code 
   in *frame*.  Display functions are assigned to ('patch') placeholder
   functions in *sked*.

-  9 Feb 2023: Remove *shells* directory and *pycall*, not needed.

-  2 Feb 2023: Make the *ed* branch for work on our line editor *sked.py*.

-  1 Feb 2023: Add *shells* directory with *pycall* callable Python interpreter.

-  1 Feb 2023: Delete most files and directories for a fresh start.
   Revise *BRANCH.md*, *DIRECTORIES.md*, and *bin/paths*.
