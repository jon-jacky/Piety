This is the *rewrite* branch.  

Beginning in Feb 2023, a total rewrite of the Piety system is underway
here in the *rewrite* branch, to simplify the code and improve its
organization and clarity.

The *master* branch and the *version1* tag contain the original Piety
system described in *Piety/README.md*.  It might be quite a while
before the code in *rewrite* provides equivalent functionality to
the code in *master*.

Recent work in the *rewrite* branch:

- 1 Feb 2023: Delete most files and directories for a fresh start.
  Revise *BRANCH.md*, *DIRECTORIES.md*, and *bin/paths*.
