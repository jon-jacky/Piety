This page provides information and links about some unusual operating
systems.  Most are responses to this impulse:

> *Today's operating systems and applications are bloated and
> complicated.  Let's start over, and create a complete system that is
> small, easy to understand, and fun to program.  And, let's build it
> all in our favorite language!*

This seductive idea recurs among each generation of programmers.  It
has inspired some interesting experiments and a few influential
systems.  Alan Kay explained the rationale
[here](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2004001_power.pdf):

> "... *in programming there is a widespread first order theory that one
> shouldn't build one's own tools, languages, and especially operating
> systems.  This is true --- an incredible amount of time and energy has
> gone down these ratholes.  On the second hand, if you* **can** *build your
> own tools, languages, and operating systems you* **absolutely should**
> *because the leverage that can be obtained (and often the time not
> wasted in trying to fix other people's not quite right tools) can be
> incredible.*"

Here are some examples.

Key to **T** (project **Type**) column, perhaps an indicator of
project size and longevity:

* **C** ommercial product sold to customers, including ongoing support

* **R** esearch and Development, usually sponsored by industry or
government.  Some of these are almost like commercial products
( **C** above), except the product is not sold, but distributed
by other means.

* **A** cademic research by a group at a university, often supported
in part by grants from government or industry

* **S** tudent project by an individual or small group, for a course
or thesis.  Usually development ends when the student completes the
course or graduates.

* **P** ersonal project by an individual or small group


Key to **Substrate** column:

* **Bare machine** 
The system includes an operating system kernel written mostly
In the favored language, with only a minimal amount of C or assembler.
The "bare machine" might actually be virtual machine or emulator
such as QEMU or Bochs.

* **Virtual Machine** Similar to Bare machine, but the system is
designed from the beginning to be deployed only on VMs.  Such systems
are sometimes called *unikernels*.

* **OS components** The system runs on a minimal OS built from
components chosen from a collection such as [Flux OSKit](http://www.cs.utah.edu/flux/oskit/) or [Rump Kernel](https://github.com/rumpkernel/wiki/wiki).

* **Native OS** The system runs on top of a conventional OS.
Programmers and users working in the favored language can mostly avoid
the conventional OS.  Such systems are sometimes called *hosted OS*.

* **Sandbox** The system runs on top of a conventional OS, in a
self-contained environment where most of the the host's facilities are
not available.  Programmers and users working in the sandbox can only
use the utilities provided in the favored language.

Not shown in the table are several OS for mobile devices: 
[Chromium](http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os)
(also [here](http://dev.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/software-architecture)),
[Android](http://www.android-x86.org/) 
(also [here](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/11/14/What-Android-Is)), 
[Firefox OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_OS) 
(aka [B2G](https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G/Architecture)),
[Joli OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joli_OS),
and [iOS](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Miscellaneous/Conceptual/iPhoneOSTechOverview/Introduction/Introduction.html).
Each is a Linux (or OS X) kernel supporting a
browser or browser-like applications.  None features a start-from-scratch 
ethos, a single language, or a deliberately simple design.
